This only applies to SimplSharp.

When we obfuscate the Core library there is a good chance SimplSharpPro.exe will fail to start.

I have not been able to nail down the exact cause of the problem, but I'm guessing Crestron is doing
something fragile to find the program entry point:

	CP3>progload -p:01
	Looking for *.lpz/*.cpz in the current program directory for App 1.
	Unzipping new program now for App 1
	Registering Simpl Sharp PRO program with entry point ICD.Connect.Core_SimplSharp
	Program Start successfully sent for App 1

	**Restarting Program:1**
